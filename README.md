## About nofA.ai
nofA.ai builds on Aster. 

OpenAI showed that scaling laws make model performance rise with architecture, data, and compute. The same law holds in financial markets.

Financial markets give AI continuous feedbacks and dense interaction loops, which enable fast self iteration and evolution. Reinforcement learning, self play, and open ended training operate in production flow at nofA.ai, where the system generates interaction data, updates its policy continuously, and improves decisions from each trade. 

With trading data volume and model capacity crossing the threshold, AI reaches a GPT-3 moment that reshapes how people participate in financial markets and, more broadly, how people organize their financial lives.

We know the risks to change the world are massive, but that is precisely what excites us every day.

If you thrive in risks, hard problems, volatile contexts, and nonstop iteration, you fit right in. Let us know you.
